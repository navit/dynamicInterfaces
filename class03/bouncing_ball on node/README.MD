This is a simple, crappy HTTP server. I wouldn't use this exact source code for live sites but it just shows that nodejs can be built to do that.

If you wanted to build a full fledged site off of node I'd recommend Express. http://expressjs.com/
	
	npm install express

For databases I'd recommened either MySQL or MongoDB.

	brew install mysql
	brew install mongodb

	npm install mysql
	npm install mongodb
